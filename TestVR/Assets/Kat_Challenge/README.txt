Hiya, my name's Kat. Thanks a lot for checking out my little game!
It's called "Kitten Catcher", and I hope you find the little kitties cute.
I made them myself! :)


Some things to get out of the way:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.) Make sure to add the "StartGame" and "Challenge" scenes to the Build settings.

-> Go to File (top left corner) in the Unity Editor
-> Go to Build Settings
-> Drag and drop the "StartGame" and "Challenge" scenes into the "Scenes in Build"
blank space at the top.
--> Make sure the boxes next to the scene names are checked.


2.) Make sure that you are running the game in the "StartGame" scene. 

-> Double click on "StartGame" scene to open it.
-> You'll see the scene and its objects in your Hierarchy!
-> Enter PlayMode (Play button at the top of the Unity Editor screen)


3.) Make sure that you maximize the Game window for a bigger screen to play from.

-> Look for your Game window (window that says "Game" with a little controller icon)
-> Along the top right side of the window, look for the "Maximize On Play" tab
-> Click on "Maximize On Play" tab (it'll be highlighted a lighter gray color)


4.) Have fun!!! My record is 00:07, so 7 seconds. Can you beat it?!
